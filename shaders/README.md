## Shader file extensions
```
.vert - a vertex shader
.tesc - a tessellation control shader
.tese - a tessellation evaluation shader
.geom - a geometry shader
.frag - a fragment shader
.comp - a compute shader
```

### FYI
Extensions are to identify diferenet types of shaders.
But it is not necessary to use these extensions. You can use any extension you want because c++ will compile shader as a string.
